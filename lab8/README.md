The Advertising.csv file contains the dataset used in the app.R file.

Running app.R results in the creation of a shiny document. This document allows  
a user to select "Newspaper", "Radio", or "Television" from a dropdown menu. The user then  
clicks a "Generate Graph" button, thus causing a scatterplot to be generated. This scatterplot  
demonstrates the relationship between Sales and the user's selected mode of advertising.
